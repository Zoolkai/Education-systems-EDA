# Education-systems-EDA
Analyze data from education systems to support the international expansion of an e-learning company.

#### Data Source
World Bank data are available at the following address:
https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/education-statistics

#### Data Description
The main dataset (EdStatsData) have each Indicator/Country pair as a data point (242 countries and region and 3665 indicators, so 886930 data points in total), and for each pair we have 66 columns each corresponding to a year of measurement of the indicator (from 1970 to 2100).

#### Project Goal
The goal of the project is to understand this dataset, get some insights from it, and finally to answer the following problematics :
- Which countries have a high potential of customers for a e-learning company?
- For each of these countries, what will be the evolution of this customer potential?
- In which countries should the e-elearning company primarily operate?  

#### Conclusion 
- India and China are countries that will develop a strong potential of customers in the next 15 years. 
- The United States is a very interesting market because of its population, its already acquired development and offers a 15-30 year horizon with a growing number of tertiary and secondary school graduates.
- Ireland is a country with a population of 15-30 to 60% secondary school graduates, which also offers good prospects for the future. 
- Singapore has a smaller population and therefore a potential target, however it is a city with high internet access and a population with 80% higher education, however due to their low birth rate the growth of the potential target in 15 years time is not good.
